# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Casino games with tokens as bettings items. Maybe add a menu to toggle over to play games. 
The whole program ends when you lose all tokens. Perhaps add a maximum to shoot for that will
also end the game.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I do not have any questions at least for now.
