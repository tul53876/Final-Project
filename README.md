#In this project I believe I learned a lot when it comes to some of the rules and executions of games. The things that need to be taken into account throughout, different outcomes, and most importantly trying to make it fun with the knowledge and resources available. Some challanges were had with the betting system, but I believe that I was able to get it almost entirely as I wanted it to be. I say almost, because I was not able to code a menu to load different parts of the file without having to comment things out. I also had some issues with the slot machine showing more outputs than it should. Fortunately I was able to get it to display the proper token winnings based on the last output. I probably had the most fun however, with the slot machine and roulette because of the amount of possible outcomes. Hopefully the games are deep enough where you put in decent consideration of how much you are willing to lose.
