# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Tokens and Casino Games

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Betting tokens on a few casino games. The program ends when you run out of tokens.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will feature three games offered throughout casinos: Craps, a slot machine, and black jack. You will be able to bet
tokens between each game with the minimum and maximum amounts varying between them. There will be a menu you can use at the start 
and each time you choose to exit one of the games. When your amount of tokens becomes equal to or less than 0, the program will end.
Outside of getting 0, one of the options in the menu will allow you to end the program if you choose. If your token count is less
than the minimum betting amount for the game you will be asked to pick something else.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be that each game works as it should with token betting.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All of the games work, the game ends at a token amount less than or equal to 0.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The games all work, it ends when the tokens are less than or equal to 0, there is a menu that you can use to choose a game, 
you won't be able to play a game if your token amount is less than the betting minimum.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research how each of the games work. I'll need to learn how to incorporate a menu system that can access different
parts of a program file without running it all at once. The tokens will need to be affected by each game and have the game end once
they hit 0. Games should become locked if you don't have enough tokens. When a certain game is accessed, I'll also put information
on the rules of the game.
